                <p>Hello! My name is Maros and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.</p>
                <p>I’m a software engineer specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences. Currently, I’m focused on building accessible, human-centered products at ChicChicApp.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <p align="justify">As a passionate Software Engineer, and a long-time admirer of cutting-edge technologies, with significant programming experience, technical expertise, and the several jobs I completed in software development, I am confident I have the key skills to be a great asset to any team.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p align="justify">Working in my current job at ChicChicApp, I have two years of experience with systems architecture, full-stack web development using Django and NodeJS, but for most Back-end engineering experience. Working with Senior Back-End Engineers, I have been responsible for developing new features for mobile applications serving millions of users monthly. Likewise, I have delivered new websites for the company which can be accessed  <i class="fa fa-star"></i>  <a href="https://www.chicchicapp.com">HERE</a>  <i class="fa fa-star"></i></p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Back-End Technologies</h4>
                        <li>Django, Flask, FastAPI, Spring, NodeJS</li>
                        <h4>Front-End Technologies</h4>
                        <li>ReactJS, Pug, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</li>
                        <h4>Cloud Technologies</h4>
                        <li>AWS, Azure, Terraform, Kafka, CI/CD</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="flex-row">
                    <br/>
                    <p align="justify">I also oversee the building of systems architecture with FLASK, HTML5 and JavaScript. I have also gained experience in DevOps, providing solutions in programming and database technology, programming, and operating systems. I also have experience in Agile project management, data science, and creating and maintaining custom web and mobile applications.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>I Love To Travel in My Spare Time.</h4>
                    <p align="justify">I believe that travel is so much more than simply seeing the sights – that travel, and the things you learn from it, can really change your life.

                        I travel to grow as a person, to meet others who inspire and educate me and to (hopefully!) do the same in return, to have my life enriched by the beauty and diversity of this amazing world and to have my eyes, mind and heart opened wide.
                        
                        I travel to make the most of my time on earth, to make every day count, instead of counting down the days till the weekend or to a 2 week vacation – because life is simply too short for me to live it any other way!
